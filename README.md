## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install desktop-2fa
```

Verify installation:

```bash
python -c "import desktop_2fa; print(desktop_2fa.__version__)"
# Output: 0.7.1
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Add a new TOTP token
d2fa add GitHub GitHub JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP

# List all entries
d2fa list

# Generate a code
d2fa code GitHub

# Initialize a new vault
d2fa init-vault
```

### Non-Interactive Usage

```bash
# Provide password via command line
d2fa --password mypassphrase add GitHub GitHub JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP

# Provide password via file
d2fa --password-file /path/to/passphrase.txt add GitHub GitHub JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
```

## 📁 Vault Lifecycle

The vault is an encrypted storage file located at `~/.desktop-2fa/vault`.

### Vault Creation

When a command requires a vault and none exists:

1. The CLI prompts for a new password (interactive mode) or requires `--password`/`--password-file` (non-interactive mode)
2. An empty encrypted vault is created
3. **A confirmation message is always printed:** `Vault created at <path>`

### Vault Loading

When a command requires a vault and it exists:

1. The CLI prompts for the existing password (interactive mode) or requires credentials (non-interactive mode)
2. The vault is decrypted and loaded
3. If the password is invalid, the CLI exits with `typer.Exit(1)`

### Duplicate Entry Handling

The `rename` command enforces deterministic behavior when multiple entries match the target name:

- If **multiple entries** match the provided name (issuer or account_name), the rename is **aborted**
- Error message: `Error: Multiple entries named '<name>' exist. Operation aborted. Resolve duplicates first.`
- No entry is renamed in this case
- This check occurs **before** any mutation

## 📖 CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `d2fa add <name> <issuer> <secret>` | Add a new TOTP entry |
| `d2fa list` | List all entries |
| `d2fa code <name>` | Generate TOTP code |
| `d2fa rename <old> <new>` | Rename an entry |
| `d2fa remove <name>` | Remove an entry |
| `d2fa export <path>` | Export vault to JSON |
| `d2fa import <path>` | Import from JSON |
| `d2fa backup` | Create a backup |
| `d2fa init-vault` | Initialize new vault |

---

## 🔒 Security

The vault uses:
- **AES-256-GCM** for authenticated encryption
- **Argon2id** for key derivation (time_cost=4, memory_cost=128MiB, parallelism=2)
- **Versioned header** for forward compatibility

Every command requires explicit password authentication. No session-based access.

### Security Hardening (v0.7.1)
Version 0.7.1 includes a security patch that prevents sensitive information from being exposed through error messages and logging. Exception details are sanitized to ensure no secrets or password-related data appear in CLI output.
